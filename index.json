Despite the rise of algorithms and curated news apps, I still believe RSS remains one of the best ways to build a personalized feed that you own.\nRecently, Iâ€™ve been reevaluating how RSS fits into my workflows. To better understand what I need from it now, Iâ€™ve reflected on what has worked for me in the pastâ€”and what hasnâ€™t.\nGoogle Reader #My first real expirence with RSS was with Google Reader (RIP). Back then, I used it primarily to track my favorite websites in one place. It wasnâ€™t anything fancy, but it was a start. Unfortunately, a combination of Google shutting down the service and my growing use of Reddit led me to abandon RSS entirely.\nRegrettably, I didnâ€™t save my OPML file â€” a mistake I would repeat.\nTT-RSS: A Golden Age #My next attempt at RSS feels like a golden age. I was learning DevOps skills, deploying various tools and services, and came across TT-RSS. This highly customizable application allowed me to fine-tune my RSS experience.\nTwo features stood out:\nFull-article fetching: This ensured I didnâ€™t have to visit ad-filled or inaccessible websites. And it provided a consistent reading expirence. Scoring system: I could assign positive or negative points to articles based on their source or content. For example, I might give WebsiteA a score of +5 but reduce points for articles mentioning SubjectA with -10, effectively curating my feed before I even saw it. While I loved these features, maintaining the system eventually became too time-consuming. I shut it down â€” and, once again, lost my OPML file.\nRediscovering RSS for Productivity #I returned to RSS during a hectic period in my career, focusing on productivity and controlled information flows. This time, RSS became a tool for professional growth rather than casual interest. It helped me stay up to date across industries without the distractions of social media.\nI experimented with several readers, but two stood out:\nReeder 5: A clean, organized app that I enjoyed using but found lacking for capturing deeper insights. Readwise Reader: A powerful tool for collecting and acting on articles, though I became overwhelmed by the sheer volume of content. At one point, I had over 50,000 articles savedâ€”a clear sign my system wasnâ€™t sustainable. Less Is More #Now, Iâ€™m shifting to a simpler, more intentional approach. Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™ve learned about making RSS work for me:\nKeep it interesting: A mix of professional and personal interests prevents burnout or wasted time. Let go of perfection: Not every article needs to be saved or dissected. Sometimes reading is just reading. Streamline article handling: For important articles, I can quickly move them to Readwise for deeper engagement. Customize feeds: Filtering out irrelevant content reduces noise and improves focus. Balance feed frequency: Some feeds dominate with frequent posts, overshadowing less active but equally valuable sources. Prioritize accessibility: A good interface that works consistently across devices is crucial. Exploring New Options #With these lessons in mind, Iâ€™m considering a few options for the future:\nRevive TT-RSS #Setting up TT-RSS again could meet most of my needs, especially its scoring system. However, the interface feels outdated compared to other tool, and the extra work to maintain it is not appealing.\nEmbrace the New Reeder #The developer of Reeder recently launched a new version with a timeline-based approach. This aligns with my goal of treating articles as transient, rather than something to hoard.\nRefine the ReadWise Reader Workflow #By dividing content between Readwise (for in-depth articles and \u0026ldquo;important\u0026rdquo; sources) and Reeder (for casual browsing), I could create a more focused system. However, this split approach risks neglecting one platform over the other.\nMoving Forward #For now, Iâ€™m giving Reeder.app an honest effort. Its integration with services like BlueSky and Mastodon adds a layer of connectivity I find interesting, as well as with YouTube.\nWill this approach work? Perhaps. Things are always changing, but for now, it feels like an engaging way to stay informed, educated, and entertained.\n","date":"10 January 2025","permalink":"/posts/revisiting-rss/","section":"Posts","summary":"Revisiting how I use RSS","title":"Revisiting RSS"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/rss/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Rss"},{"content":" My small internet potagerie ðŸŒ± #","date":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Ryan P.

A lot of these articles have very helpful techniques, but I want to cover how people could realistically adopt the techniques.\nBecause as we know, strong defenses are only useful if they actually get used.\nFirst letâ€™s start with making a scammers job harder to begin with.\nLockdown accounts #This isnâ€™t just make sure you have secure passwords and MFA - which you should have. Locking down your accounts means being aware of what you post, how someone could determine information about you, like where you are, problems you might have, interests they could tempt you with, and so on.\nWith AI, if there are videos or pictures of you - which I am sure there are of most people - then you could be cloned fairly easily. Honestly I donâ€™t expect people to not post these types of things, which is why diligence is key.\nMaking accounts private, culling your followers, using multiple accounts to professional and personal interests. These can help minimize the potential knowledge scope on you if you are targeted.\nAdditionally, making sure you can recover your accounts and that your recovery email is well protected.\nIn short:\nMake sure your posts arenâ€™t more revealing than you want them to be Know who follows you Take your account private by default Consider multiple accounts to split between public and private This is something everyone should do, and you should do it on a cadence that makes sense. Because settings change, your tolerance for posting personal information changes and all that should be considered over time.\nSet up strong authentication #Get a password manager, randomize your passwords, and if possible randomize your emails too! On top of all that, set up MFA where possible. I suggest software plus hardware (like a YubiKey).\nAlso, if you are helping a parent or loved one, then a family account with the password sharing may help when needed. We have all been there when their parent canâ€™t remember the password to an account they need your help with, and you have to go through the recovery dance.\nAvoid clicking suspicious links #This should also be an obvious one, but just donâ€™t click links you donâ€™t trust. These are links randomly texted to you, or just donâ€™t look right (like fedex-com[.]net).\nNow obviously clicking on links in social media is going to happen. Just make sure before you do click. And if youâ€™re a bit suspicious of it. Google the website and the title of the article instead.\nWith that being said, suppose youâ€™re targeted and a bad actor is realistically posing as someone you know. Maybe itâ€™s a phone call, or a voice message, or even as sophisticated as a video call - all leveraging AI tooling.\nSecret family codes #I see this being suggested a lot. And it can be helpful, but really it is a historical knowledge challenge. So, realistically the best way to leverage this in your daily life is to ask questions only the two of you might know. Like a conversation you had previously or the last place you ate and what you ordered.\nObviously people are human, and Iâ€™m not the only one that forgets what I had eaten a day or two later. Also, as mentioned earlier, depending how open your life is on the internet someone might know what you ate last Sunday because you posted it on your stories.\nBetter yet would be to use intimate knowledge. These are things like inside jokes the two of you might have, personal discussions or other things that have a very low chance of being online.\nWhich is why creating a code phrase can still be helpful, as it is a better type of shared knowledge - intimate knowledge.\nSecondary channel of communication #Another way to check if someone is who they say they are is to either ask them to send you the same message on a known secure form of communication you two share. This could be instagram DMs, signal messaging, or something where they need to authenticate to access. Or you could reach out yourself and not tell them youâ€™re planning to do it.\nNow this isnâ€™t perfect either, especially if the bad actor has already compromised those accounts and has access.\nThird person check #Now if you really arenâ€™t sure how compromised that person might be. You can also reach out to someone else that is close with them to check. Depending on the time of day it could be a colleague, or a partner, someone you expect them to be with at that moment, have seen recently or will see soon. They can then work one physically finding the person to confirm if it is them. Or might be able to confirm the request.\nLastly is education, not only for yourself but others around you. Knowing not only who is aware, but also the extent they are capable of. The sad truth is, the most vulnerable are often targeted the most. Knowing who you might have around that needs the extra help can make all the difference in the world.\nAgain, the best tools are the ones that are used, and the more in use the more layers of defense you have available.\nHow scams are changing #I want to reiterate that who this is most important for isnâ€™t necessarily going to be the reader, nor most of their immediate friends and family. It will be the grandparents and older generations. Yes I do hope you learn something or use one of these techniques, but I also want you to be proactive.\nThereâ€™s an event I was told of, which didnâ€™t involve AI but is of the same vein of directed attacks. The scammer was watching a home of an elderly woman. Their adult children were visiting and some left for home. About 10 minutes later the woman received a phone call from the scammer, posing as one of the people that had just left, saying that the other was in trouble with the police and needed to pay a fine otherwise they were going to go to jail. Luckily the woman didnâ€™t recognize the voice, and instead called someone else to check.\nNow imagine if this same tactic added AI generated voice copies of the person they know? Just being that little more convincing could have lead to a successful scam. Itâ€™s these enhancements that people need to be prepared for.\nAs with everything in security, the bad actors only need to succeed once - so be diligent!\n","date":"30 December 2024","permalink":"/posts/ai-doppelganger-scams/","section":"Posts","summary":"How Generative AI Improves Scammer Tools","title":"AI doppelgÃ¤nger Scams"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/fraud/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Fraud"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/scams/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Scams"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/blog/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Blog"},{"content":" Data breaches are a constant, what can you do? Introduction #Unfortunately, it\u0026rsquo;s highly likely that your information will be exposed at some point. This has become a common enough occurrence that instead of asking, \u0026ldquo;If it happens, what do I do?\u0026rdquo; it\u0026rsquo;s more prudent to ask, \u0026ldquo;When it happens, have I prepared enough to minimize the impact?\u0026rdquo;\nIâ€™ve considered this from various angles, but one method of protection worth discussing is \u0026ldquo;Hide My Email Services\u0026rdquo; like Apple\u0026rsquo;s service with iCloud, or Proton\u0026rsquo;s service and how these services can be used to protect your privacy.\nKeep in mind though, that whenever you plan to increase your security or privacy you will, in most cases, lose some convenience or ease of use.\nWhat Are Hide My Email Services? #To start, these services create an alias that will relay any emails sent to it directly to your main email address. These aliases are often a randomly generated name with one or several domains. So, if your email is jdoe@gmail.com and you use Apple\u0026rsquo;s Service, it will generate an email like Jade.0a.Kiwi@icloud.com. You can then use this email for a website, and even generate multiple aliases that point back to jdoe@gmail.com\nThink of it as having an unlimited number forwarding addresses for your main email.\nWebsite --Sends Email--\u0026gt; Alias Email --Forwards--\u0026gt; Main Email Aliases Alternatives #Some email services also offer a similar feature by allowing you to append a + to your email address. So jdoe@gmail.com can use something like jdoe+facebook@gmail.com as an email for Facebook. This would allow them to know that, in theory, only emails from Facebook should be going to that email, and if they get something from somewhere else they may be able to assume that the email was sold, exposed, or otherwise leaked.\nNow, the issue with this from a privacy perspective is that the root email is clearly exposed. Instead, the goal is to make it difficult to guess your main email address and to ensure your provided email is as unlinkable to you as possible.\nWhen to Use Hide My Email Services #Now that we know, in general, that these services offer an ability to create unique, random emails that can be used to protect your main email, let\u0026rsquo;s discuss when it might be appropriate to use these services, and the drawbacks in each case. I will order these in what I think are the best way to start as a path to more \u0026ldquo;advanced\u0026rdquo; usage.\nLevel 1: This is just temporary #If you run into a site or service that needs an email, but you don\u0026rsquo;t ever plan to really manage the account (I will come back to this point though) then this is a perfect service for that.\nSuppose you\u0026rsquo;re at a restaurant and want to place an order through their website, which requires an email address. You can use these services to generate a temporary email, complete your order, and then delete that email to prevent any future spam.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s really it! Use the service as a temporary email, you can make just one for all use cases or generate a new one every time. I would suggest making a unique one for each, if possible, because that let\u0026rsquo;s you get used to managing multiple ones at ones and move on to the next level.\nLevel 2: Why do I Have to Make an Account?! #Okay, so same as before, you\u0026rsquo;re in a situation where you have to not only provide an email, but also make an account. Rather than using your main email, use a Hidden email instead! Additionally, make sure to use your password manager to generate a random password.\nThis site will now send spam only to your randomly generated email. And since the site now has associated login credentials, it could potentially be a source for email and password leaks. However, since they are both random, it is basically just junk. Sure you do need to make sure to secure that account the best you can, remove any other information, credit cards, etc.\nBut now this data cannot be used to comprise your accounts on other sites.\nLevel 3: Change My Email #At this point, I hope you see where we are going. Taking this a step further, we can start changing our non-critical accounts to use Hide My Email services. Randomly generate a new email, log in to your site still using your root email, and then change it. Oh, and update your password while you are there to make sure it is fully randomized while you are there; and set up MFA.\nRemember, this is only protecting you when it comes to linking the email to you directly and cross referencing/attacking to other sites.\nI will want to also add a note here that you should take care on which sites you do this with. For social media, video game accounts, shopping accounts, there shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be too much of a risk using these emails. However, financial sites, government accounts, and other \u0026ldquo;Identity based sites\u0026rdquo; you may want to use your root email or other softer alias techniques like the + appending technique. Why? Well, it could be more frustrating to maintain or get support with a randomly generated email. Also, these sites tend to, but not always, have a stronger security posture. Remember, we are looking at minimizing impact here, not remove it entirely!\nIs it worth the effort? #To summarize what we can do here is:\nGet a new service, and yet another subscription. Give spammers meaningless, disposable emails. Use throw-away emails for throw-away accounts. Move existing accounts to these new, randomly generated emails. This helps isolate sites to a single email, lowering the value of your data provided and protecting you from being identified in a data leak. Additionally, in combination with randomly generated passwords, helps to isolate credential stuffing attacks to just that one site.\nBut, it isn\u0026rsquo;t all perfect. There are some negatives to consider!\nNegatives #Communication #There are times when you may need to send an email from that randomly generated address, like when reaching out to support. This can be clunky or even impossible, depending on the service, and it\u0026rsquo;s generally not as simple as using your regular email address.\nAlso, trying to call support, or provide the email can get you some odd looks. And it is cumbersome to generate one in person, but not a non-stopper.\nAuthenticity #Another thing to be aware of, some sites have protections around temporary email addresses, particularly ones like 10minutemail. This can lead to issues where your generated email may not be accepted if the domain isn\u0026rsquo;t well known. For example, Apple\u0026rsquo;s uses icloud.com as the domain, which is well known and accepted in most cases. However if you use a service that uses less known domains, or you can use your own, that can lead to issues with the email not being accepted.\nService Provider trust #A significant concern with these services is that all emails going to those alias addresses are accessible to the service providers. For example, Apple could, in theory, see what is sent to Jade.0a.Kiwi@icloud.com.\nData breaches #When a breach happens you can go to places like Have I been Pwned and put in your email to see where you were affected. However, now you don\u0026rsquo;t see all your potential accounts, as most will have a unique email. In these cases, usually the site does send you an email to alert you, so you will want to monitor for those a bit more actively. When you do get one, you can do your normal response like resetting the password, but also reset the email!\nAll in all #Is this worth it? For you, I don\u0026rsquo;t know. But for me, it is worth applying some of these items.\n","date":"29 October 2024","permalink":"/posts/hide-your-email/","section":"Posts","summary":"Data breaches are a constant, what can you do?","title":"Hide Your Email Services"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/privacy/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Privacy"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/security/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Security"},{"content":" A scalable site. Introduction # Info: This is not a full step by step guide, but one that can be used in combination with the standard guides available! Also I plan to update this after some time, so it will get better. ðŸ™ˆ For those curious this guide is how I got this site up and running using a combination of Github, as the deployment automation and hosting of the site, and Hugo, a static website generator tool, using the Congo theme. This is all better documented on all the referenced sites, but this might help with bridging any gaps, or maybe provide a more concentrated interpretation of the above guides.\nThe assumptions are that you know your way around the terminal and know how to use tools like git, brew (for macs) and modify your domain\u0026rsquo;s DNS.\nAll references can be found at the following sites:\nhttps://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/ - Hugo quickstart guide. I would start here if you have no idea what is going on. https://jpanther.github.io/congo/docs/installation/ - An end to end guide from the theme\u0026rsquo;s creator. Really this should cover most everything. https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages - Important information using GitHub Pages (which is what we will be doing) https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site - Important information on DNS for your domain to point it to GitHub Pages. https://github.com/CodeOnRye/codeonrye.github.io - Lastly, here is all the code running this site, so you could always start from there!\nSchema #First let\u0026rsquo;s lay out all the pieces to best understand how this will work.\ngraph TD A[Repository Markdown Files] --\u003e|Git Commit| B(GitHub) B --\u003e C{GitHub Actions} C --\u003e|Watches Main Branch| B C --\u003e F(Runs Hugo) F --\u003e|Processes MD to HTML| G(Pushed to gh_pages Branch) D[Domain Registrar] --\u003e|A Record| E(github.io) G --\u003e B E --\u003e G subgraph Local A end subgraph GitHub B C F G end subgraph DNS D E end As shown, wherever you may be sourcing your markdown files, once they are pushed to GitHub then the magic starts happening. A GitHub Action will run on commits, running a hugo service to generate the html files and pushing them back to a specific branch, gh_pages. This branch is configured in the repository to be the source for the github site. On the other end, the DNS registrar has an A Record set so that it redirects to the GitHub Provided site. Once it is all set up, then all you need to do is update your Hugo files and push!\nGitHub #You should start by setting up your GitHub repository and various settings as needed. This will help prepare for the automations and configurations later.\nCreate Your Repo #One thing that got me, was that since we want to point to use the GitHub Pages functionality, we have to name the repository YOURUSERNAME.github.io. There may be another way to do this, but this is what I did.\nOnce created, go ahead and clone it down to your local environment.\ngit clone git@github.com:YOURUSERNAME/YOURUSERNAME.github.io.git Hugo #First things first. You need to get Hugo up and running and become familiar enough with it. Use the linked guide above to just try setting up a quick one locally. Once you get a feel comfortable with how it works with markdown files, then we can initialize it in the repository file we created in previous step.\ncd /PATH/TO/YOURUSERNAME.github.io hugo new site ./ Congo Theme #Next we will install and set up the theme. As all themes are different, this may not apply to others, so take that with a grain of salt if you are deviating here.\nWe need to first pull down the theme, to do this we will use the git submodule function. This keeps our tooling from becoming more complex.\ncd /PATH/TO/YOURUSERNAME.github.io git init git submodule add -b stable https://github.com/jpanther/congo.git themes/congo Next we will need to configure Hugo to use this Theme. The theme\u0026rsquo;s guide is best to follow, as it will be more up-to-date. But to boil it down you need to copy the /PATH/TO/YOURUSERNAME.github.io/theme/congo/config/_default folder to /PATH/TO/YOURUSERNAME.github.io/. Now we customize the files as needed.\nconfig.toml - Your main config file for Hugo where you set your website name, theme (congo) and other settings languages.en.toml - Sets your defaults for the site when set in the en language. markup.toml - Used for the theme, I have not touched this. menus.en.toml - Like languages.en.toml, this is the configuration for the menus when set to the en language. module.toml - Used for the theme, I have not touched this. params.toml - Allows you to further configure the theme. Making a Post #With this theme, I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to set up my posts within their own folders, rather than all under the ./content/ folder. This seems to work best for this theme. So a post will look roughly like this\ncontent/posts/building-my-site â”œâ”€â”€ img â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ gh_actions_permissions.png â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ gh_pages_config.png â”‚ â””â”€â”€ gh_workflow_permissions.png â””â”€â”€ index.md Notice that the markdown file is named index.md and not the name of the post, that is reserved for the folder name. More examples can be found here\nGitHub Actions #Lastly, once you have a nice site configured, and you\u0026rsquo;ve tested it out locally with the hugo server -D we can start working on getting the automations going to publish this online.\nGitHub Actions Workflow File #You can leverage the default one provided by the theme here. This should work out of the box for you. Once you add it to your /PATH/TO/YOURUSERNAME.github.io/.github/workflows/ folder and push it to GitHub you will need to verify it runs successfully.\nOne thing to note here, if you are going to use a custom domain you will want to add a run command into your YAML file to recreate that file like below:\n... - name: Build run: hugo --minify - name: GH CNAME run: echo \u0026#34;YOURDOMAIN.COM\u0026#34; \u0026gt; ./public/CNAME - name: Deploy ... On GitHub you can navigate to your repository, and then the Actions Page to verify if it is running properly. If not you will want to check the follow settings.\nGitHub Repository Settings #Make sure your settings are as follows:\nThose should fix it to allow the actions to properly run. Once they do you will now have a gh_pages branch that mirror\u0026rsquo;s the contents of the public folder that Hugo generates when running the hugo commands.\nDNS #Last but not least, we will now make the site available online! First we finish configuring GitHub, test and then point our domain to it.\nGitHub Pages #Under the repository\u0026rsquo;s settings for Pages you will want to configure it as follows\nA few things to note, you can only enable SSL enforcement once your custom domain is configured (next step). But this will be fine for now to test. You should now be able to got to YOURUSERNAME.github.io and see your site! If you do then finish configurations on your domain registrar.\nDomain DNS #First you should go to your account settings, then under the Pages option on the left sidebar, add your domain there. You will need to verify the domain with a TXT Record .\nPer the details from GitHub you will want to add the follow records to your Domain\u0026rsquo;s DNS provider.\nA Record\n185.199.108.153 185.199.109.153 185.199.110.153 185.199.111.153 AAAA Record\n2606:50c0:8000::153 2606:50c0:8001::153 2606:50c0:8002::153 2606:50c0:8003::153 CNAME Record\nwww.YOURDOMAIN.com I would avoid using the Alias, as that would block you from using DNSSEC.\nAt this point you should now be able to go to yourdomain.com and load your github site. If needed, go back to your settings and enable SSL.\nConclusion #This rough guide is how I have mine set up with tips on how you can do it yourself. Again, it isn\u0026rsquo;t meant to be an end-to-end guide. But over time I will probably update this guide to better clarify or expand items.\n","date":"18 March 2024","permalink":"/posts/building-my-site/","section":"Posts","summary":"A scalable site.","title":"Building My Site"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/guide/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Guide"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/hugo/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Hugo"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/website/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Website"},{"content":" Hello World. Introduction #The classic initialization of any project always ends up beginning with those words. I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to take another shot at curating a digital space for myself. In the past I have tried to create websites using various frameworks and tools, but they always became more work than I felt they were worth. Looking back, I\u0026rsquo;ve always tried to create something more complex than I needed. Hoping to grow into it, rather than grow with it. But I really hadn\u0026rsquo;t hammered out the foundation of what I actually needed, and focused on what I wanted. Taking a step back I wanted to focus on what I needed from this projected. With hopes that the choices will be flexible enough to not require a lot of work to expand later or maintain.\nThose needs have boiled down to the following.\nDefining My Goals #In short, answering this was the hardest part. Simply \u0026ldquo;a website\u0026rdquo; is too broad of an answer; I needed to really think about what content I wanted, how I wanted to present it, how it should be maintained and what I wanted to get out of my time with the project. So lets start with defining the content.\nThe content will be my own musings, or ramblings for some. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to lock myself into a certain type of topic or subject matter. So a semi-professional blog and portfolio I think will strike a balance. That means the site must be able to provide an easy way for me to both create that content and present it.\nPresentation of the website should be clean and modern. Next I need to be able to customize it once I start having a more fully formed idea of the content. So again, it needs to be a flexible solution that can be changed without much headache.\nAnd headaches is what I have gotten in the past with frameworks like wordpress or other blog focused solutions. They did so much more than I needed at the time, that I would get stuck in the weeds. I\u0026rsquo;d enable features I didn\u0026rsquo;t need, or maybe even fully understand. This solution needed to be simple, but extendable when I needed it to be.\nLastly, in the end what I want out of this project is a website I can call my own. A place that is easy for me to keep up to date both on content and patches. It had to work for me, rather than me work for it. Which has lead me to go with this set up.\nThe Project #This project is created with as minimal tools as possible; Hugo as the website generator and will be served by GitHub.\nHugo - This is the website framework tooling solution, a static website generator Github/Gitlab Pages Hosted - Since I am setting up a static website, that means no backends - and not servers - needed! So why not use Github or GitLab\u0026rsquo;s pages and actions to handle the hosting and publishing? Openness #I am always a big fan of Free and Open Source Software, FOSS for short. So where I can, I try my best to leverage systems and tools for that. Granted there comes a time where, well, time isn\u0026rsquo;t as available. Its the well-known adage of FOSS not being free in the cost of time. However, if the system is simple enough and the data portable enough, then it might very well be worth that time and effort to setup and maintain.\nThe Framework #Needing the site to be maintainable, is key to keeping the project, and thus the site, up and running. So, where I could, I would remove systems that needed my attention to work or stay in good working order. Too many website frameworks required lots of backends, databases and the like, as well as had features I simply didn\u0026rsquo;t care for. I just needed something that was dead simple to set up, run and update with new content when I felt like it.\nThe Platform #In the past I have always set up servers, installed the needed services and then install any applications to get a website up and running. But each of those items introduces complexity and friction. I need to make sure the services are up to date. The database needs to be backed up properly. How do I migrate to a new server if needed, and so on. With the static aspect of Hugo I can avoid this because, in the end, the website is just a bunch of files. And those files are already backed up in Github which is also \u0026ldquo;publishing them.\u0026rdquo; Overall reducing complexity to make it easier to maintain and use, which is exactly what I want.\nTL;DR #In short, I have set up a Hugo based static website that I can use Github Pages and Actions to host and manage! I will probably also post a guide incase someone wants to try themselves!\n","date":"25 January 2024","permalink":"/posts/hello-world/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Hello World"},{"content":"About Me #Hey!
