## New Theme

Just a quick post about the change today. I created a custom theme with the focus on having accessible colors. I used a helpful tool at https://randoma11y.com to just generate a bunch of options and landed on this one. I may tweak it a bit here or there, but so far I enjoy it.

Also I finally updated the favicon! It's nothing special, but at least it matches the default theme.
