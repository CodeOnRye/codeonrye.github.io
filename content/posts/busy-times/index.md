# Busy times 

I wanted to write for the blog for a while, in fact, I have quite a few items I want to cover and start discussing. Items like Personal Knowledge Management, rebuilding my site, thoughts on various trends - and how they have overlapped with other topics I have in mind like being more mindful on my time usage, and others. Unfortunately, I have also been very busy in life and so all that work has been put on the back burner.

I plan to get back into a routine by January, 2026. One big goal is to reevaluate the tools used for this site. I want to try to strip away the site to the bare bones and then build from there, either with Hugo or another tool. Because I haven’t build the theming myself I feel like I don't own it as much as I could.

I want to establish more of my ownership - or perhaps knowledge-ship - of the site. Until I have the new site figured out, I will most likely not be posting or updating much here. 

Until then, here is a quick, non-exhaustive, list of items I want to start covering:

## Personal Knowledge Management

I really want to explore, more for myself than anything, what my current PKM system is, and how I am trying to manage all the information around me. I feel like it would be an exciting exercise to, one, codify it and two, to identify gaps and issues with what I am doing versus what I want to be doing.

## Time Management (With heavy regards to Algorithms)

There are a few people I follow that have been pushing back on Social Media from the perspective of Algorithms. I’ve been looking and adopting a few of these to better avoid “Doomscrolling” in my various apps and websites. I’ve adopting disabling watch history on YouTube which essentially breaks their shorts feature and forces me to use the subscription tab - and it has been helpful in me avoiding time loss there. Other tactics like visiting apps from their website version compared to their native apps can reduce features and make you less likely to stay on them. Since social media apps want you to install the app their websites are intentionally more painful to use. Essentially they are using dark patterns to get you to install the app, but instead I use them as a way to dissuade myself from using the apps more.

Just finishing the book Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport has also helped me think about this topic from a new angle. The idea that it is okay to be bored, and thoughts around how I want to better control my time, attention and decisions., etc etc. 

## Process Mastery versus Process Perfection

I recently saw a [blog post ](This is, by contemporary standards, a committed relationship.)that discussed how jumping from one app to another for various processes or workflows is exhausting. They proposed that instead of trying to get the perfect process down, you instead focus on perfecting the use of the tools you already have. It’s making me consider how that overlaps with my stance on how a lot of apps are subscription based and I try my best to avoid “death-by-a-thousand-cuts.”

Like many, I see an app and think, oh that will solve a problem that I “think” I have - either because they are trying to sell a solution to a problem that doesn’t exist, or they are trying to sell an identity. Ironically, I am writing this post up with iA Writer in a trial mode to see if I find it helps me with my writing. Otherwise I will write this, and most posts in Obsidian.

## Website Rebuild?

This is the big one, the one that has been causing me delays. I am thinking about rebuilding the website with a different static site generator. Right now I use Hugo, which I have honestly not had major issues with, but I wonder if there is a better one. 11ty has caught my eye and I am looking into it at the moment. We will see if I end up changing to this or not. 

I do know, that regardless of changing the tool, I will want to build my own theme and tools for it. I enjoy the current Congo based theme, but I want to make my own, add some of my own "artistic" flair and also implement some features, like Webmentions. 

So those are some of my plans, lets see how fast, or slow, I am with them.
