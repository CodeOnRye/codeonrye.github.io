Some musings on what to do with this site.
{{< /lead >}}

I've been thinking a bit more about this site, which may soon become a running theme. Mostly as to what I currently want to get out of this site now that I am being a bit more active with it. 

Looking back, in the past I have tried to set up sites before, like LAMP servers, Wordpress installations, or used other tools. In the end, those failed because of a few things; 

- I wasn't committed to keep them up-to-date, I was more focused on learning how to set them up, rather than what to do after.
- They were set up usually on some kind of VPS like Linode or Digitial Ocean, so there was a cost to them which I didn't end up feeling was worth it to keep going in the long run.

Now, this site is a bit different. One, it is a static site, so there is a whole lot less I need to maintain to keep it up and running and secure. Two, because of nature of the site being static I can use free services like GitHub Pages, or now Cloudflare, to host the files. Three, I am "older and wiser" - in that I see a bit more value in maintaining my own website and content.

Along with that, I have been reading more and more into the ideas of the "small web" and how people are approaching it. This has helped me better shape my perspective on some of my challenges, and give me some food for thought for what I want out this site.

### Regarding the challenges

I want to continue to push myself to keep to my personal goal of posting at least monthly this year. The biggest challenge to this is taking an idea, running with it and finding an endpoint. The idea part, and even the running with it, isn't the hardest for me. But it is finding an end that feels complete. I often feel it needs to be "perfect." Which has held me back a bit.

Adjacent to the struggle to complete, I also sometimes wonder if the idea fits the site. However, in reality this is my site, which I made for myself. If others find value here, then that is great! But I shouldn't concern myself if I feel like something might not fit fully or make sense. So long as I feel the topic is interesting and worth thinking about and writing, then why not?

Thirdly, I need to not question if my "tools" for the site are perfect. I've been thinking about moving from Hugo to Ghost (or maybe some other platform). It's a mixture of feelings that makes me question my current setup; How can I make writing posts easier? Should I try to get better analytics and understanding on who might be visiting my site? Should I follow what a decent number of bloggers are doing and set up a mailing list and even potentially monetize? Or, am I just getting ahead of myself and building something just to see if I can?

Now, I would like to dive into my thoughts more about these questions, but I think it might be best to save that for another time.

### To sum it up

I am going to write more, write about things that are interesting to me, and try to better understand those that might get value from this content.

### Before I forget
You might find some of these articles interesting, as they are what spurred me to think about all this.
