summary: Just a quick update on cleaning up the site, again.

It has been a little bit since I updated, mostly because I keep creating issues for myself with some of the underlying code and git. Basically, I still have a lot to learn to keep everything synced up and paying attention to changes. Long and short, I should have everything cleaned up now and it *should* be easier for me to make updates on the blog again.

I finally got the theme, [congo](https://github.com/jpanther/congo), updated and in sync again between my fork and upstream. There was a bug for a bit where the theme wouldn't compile with Hugo because of some underlying skeleton changes with how Hugo worked. So I had that pinned to an older version to continue to generate the site. Now that is all updated, and I feel a bit better about things again.

I also removed the feature images on my blog posts, because I don't feel that I need them. I want to focus on writing and that has been a bit of a blocker. If you noticed the most recent posts didn't have any. This will keep everything a bit more consistent too.

As for actual posts beyond site updates, I do have a few things I want to write a bit about. I've been playing with [TRML](https://usetrmnl.com) as a BYOD, once that is finished it will be a decent sized post. I also have been playing with [Godot](https://godotengine.org) again, and I'd like to write up things about that. Obviously there are also topics that I continue to find interesting, like Security and AI. Really, there is a lot, I just need to be more disciplined.
