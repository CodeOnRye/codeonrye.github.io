Revisiting how I use RSS
{{< /lead >}}

Over the years, I’ve had an on-and-off relationship with RSS. Despite the rise of algorithms and curated feeds, I still believe RSS remains one of the best ways to build a personalized feed. Recently, I’ve been reevaluating how RSS fits into my workflows. To better understand what I need from it now, I’ve reflected on what has worked for me in the past—and what hasn’t.

## Google Reader

My first real foray into RSS was with Google Reader (RIP [killedbygoogle](https://killedbygoogle.com)). Back then, I used it primarily to track my favorite websites in one place. It wasn’t anything fancy, but it was a start. Unfortunately, a combination of Google shutting down the service and my growing use of Reddit led me to abandon RSS entirely.

Regrettably, I didn’t save my OPML file—a mistake I would repeat in later years.

## TTRSS: A Golden Age

My next attempt at RSS felt like a golden age. I was deep into learning DevOps skills, deploying various tools and services, and came across [TTRSS](https://tt-rss.org). This highly customizable application allowed me to fine-tune my RSS experience.

Two features stood out:
1. **Full-article fetching**: This ensured I didn’t have to visit ad-filled or inaccessible websites.
2. **Scoring system**: I could assign positive or negative points to articles based on their source or content. For example, I might give WebsiteA a score of +5 but reduce points for articles mentioning SubjectA, effectively curating my feed before I even saw it.

While I loved these features, maintaining the system eventually became too time-consuming. I shut it down—and, once again, lost my OPML file.

## Rediscovering RSS for Productivity

I returned to RSS during a hectic period in my career, focusing on productivity and controlled information flows. This time, RSS became a tool for professional growth rather than casual interest. It helped me stay up to date across industries without the distractions of social media.

I experimented with several readers, but two stood out:
- **[Reeder 5](https://reederapp.com/classic)**: A clean, organized app that I enjoyed using but found lacking for capturing deeper insights.
- **[Readwise Reader](https://readwise.io/read)**: A powerful tool for collecting and acting on articles, though I became overwhelmed by the sheer volume of content. At one point, I had over 50,000 articles saved—a clear sign my system wasn’t sustainable.

## Less Is More

Now, I’m shifting to a simpler, more intentional approach. Here’s what I’ve learned about making RSS work for me:
- **Keep it interesting**: A mix of professional and personal interests prevents burnout or wasted time.
- **Let go of perfection**: Not every article needs to be saved or dissected. Sometimes reading is just reading.
- **Streamline article handling**: For important articles, I can quickly move them to Readwise for deeper engagement.
- **Customize feeds**: Filtering out irrelevant content reduces noise and improves focus.
- **Balance feed frequency**: Some feeds dominate with frequent posts, overshadowing less active but equally valuable sources.
- **Prioritize accessibility**: A good interface that works consistently across devices is crucial.

## Exploring New Options

With these lessons in mind, I’m considering a few options for the future:

### Revive TTRSS
Setting up TTRSS again could meet most of my needs, especially its scoring system. However, the interface feels outdated compared to other tools. I might explore integrating its curated feed with another app.

### Embrace the New Reeder
The developer of Reeder recently launched a new version with a timeline-based approach. This aligns with my goal of treating articles as transient, rather than something to hoard.

### Refine the Readwise-Reeder Workflow
By dividing content between Readwise (for in-depth articles) and Reeder (for casual browsing), I could create a more focused system. However, this split approach risks neglecting one platform over the other.

## Moving Forward

For now, I’m giving [Reeder.app](https://reederapp.com) an honest effort. Its integration with services like BlueSky and Mastodon adds a layer of flexibility I find intriguing. Will this approach work? Perhaps. Things are always changing, but for now, it feels like an engaging way to stay informed, educated, and entertained.
