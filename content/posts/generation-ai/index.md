Raising the next generation.

{{< /lead >}}

I was recently talking with some friends and we came onto an interesting subject regarding the newest generation of children. We were commenting on the fact that we now know people that are solely using AI chatbots to help raise their kids. 'Oh my kid has a fever and isn't eating what do I do?' 'When my kid is teething how do I stop them from biting things?' etc.

As we all know, people like to categorize things, and this extends to grouping people based on certain characteristics of when they were born. The obvious ones are: "Baby Boomers" mainly based on the fact that there was a Boom in babies during that period. "Millennials" because they were at the turn of the millennium. While other groups are stuck with their holdover name like "Gen X", "Gen Z", and "Gen Alpha."

I'd like to propose that the next generation being born and raised right now, which I think is "Gen Beta" will be known as "Generation AI" (aka "Gen AI") because of the proliferation of AI tools becoming the new search engine.

In the past there were books, and group meetings to raise kids. Then people started googling and  moving online, but there was usually other people grouped up in these sites. Now, though, you can do all that with AI. Asking AI nuanced questions and getting answers is the strength of AI. 

So, now we are going to start seeing kids being raised by parents that will get a vast majority of their support through AI. Now, I am not going to make any sweeping thoughts on if this will be good or bad, but I do think it is interesting. Beyond to being "raised by AI", this next generation will also have AI all through their life, similar to how "Gen Alpha" is a post-internet generation. 

Anyway, I just wanted to make this post because I don't think I have seen anyone try to coin the term for the next generation, and I found it interesting.
